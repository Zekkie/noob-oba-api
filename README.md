# HOW TO USE THE OBA API IN NODE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

No panic, i will show you how


## How to install

```
	- CD into the folder and type: npm install
	- While in the folder type either node index.js or nodem index.js(for if you want to make changes and are too lazy te keep typing node index.js)

```

## How to use

```
	- by typing localhost:3000/query/type you can fetch data from the oba api
	- Where query is your subject (e.g. Mozart, J.K. Rowling etc. etc.)
	- And type is the medium you are searching for (e.g. cd, book, sheetmusic etc. etc.)
```

## TODO??

This server is very limited, so has a limit usecase. I'm not planning on extending functionality. Do you want more functionality? Add some!

Hope it helps, Cheers <3
